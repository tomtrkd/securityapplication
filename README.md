SafeCheck


SafeCheck is a firefox security plugin with the goal of protecting users with varying ranges of knowledge. This plugin is simple to use and understand and also provides in depth information about the outcome of the security checks that are being run on each of those intended websites that the user is checking. This plugin has 3 ranges of tests, which have varying complexity; a quick and base test which will allow the user to see if the website is ok for viewing, a more indepth test which has the direct use of being run on a website where some information is being entered such as the user's name and address and the final check, which is the Advanced check, which is intended to be used on websites with payment information, private information and any other security information. This then offers 3 levels of security testing and prevention for the user to choose depending on their intended use case.      

Basic Check  

The basic checks intended aim is for a local site or a small website

This test is not for large organizations or chains of shops 

While there is nothing wrong with using a domain validated/ low assurance security certificate for shopping, it would be worth it before placing any orders and paying, to ensure that you are on the legitimate intended site as it is impossible to verify the identity of the site that you are looking for to compare it against. 

Medium Check 

The Medium check would be for larger sites, such as national sites, that are not as large as sites such as amazon, for example any websites on the top trusted one million list.

This check can also be used on smaller websites but might give a false positive, as they could not be running some of the advanced security features that a larger site could be using. 


Advanced Check 

The advaged check is for mega corporations such as facebook and amazon. This test can be quite subjective and there is a small chance of a false positive; if this happens please submit feedback. 

 This check can also be used on smaller websites, but might give a false positive, as they could not be running some of the advanced security features that a large site could be using, such as websites in the top 50,000 of the top one million trusted website list.
